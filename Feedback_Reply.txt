Thank you for your valuable comments, it will be under consideration.

Graph on slide #7, it is not clear the ranking for the industry reputation is based on all the years in the dataset or only 2020?
what are the insight you gain from the graphs shown in report.
It would be great to show how some of the companies ranking improved or got worse over the years by doing some comparison over the different years.
